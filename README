Net::Libdnet
============

DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl interface for libdnet.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note that "make tests" fakes running the tests. Running them for
real is dangerous: you should do this only if you know what you
are doing.

The real tests require having a configured and connected ethernet
interface, with a default route over its (primary, not cloned) IP
address. They reversibly modify interface configurations, the ARP
table and the routing table. 

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

Do not run the real tests unless you are sure you do not harm your
configuration or other people! I decline any responsibility whatsoever
for what damage you make by running these tests.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

This being said, you need to set the environment variable REAL_TESTS
and have root privileges to run the non-faked tests.
